# Sigstore the Hard Way (Dockerized)

Sigstore the Hard Way (Dockerized) offers an alternative approach to deploying sigstore infrastructure by utilizing Docker containers instead of relying on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for compute provisioning. This project guides users through manually setting up sigstore infrastructure using Docker containers, presenting them with an alternative deployment option.

## Overview

This project is based on the original [Sigstore the Hard Way](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-the-hard-way). However, instead of relying on GCP, this version utilizes Docker containers for compute provisioning.
